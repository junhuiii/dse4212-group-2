# Data

To set up the data required for this project, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Data**:  
   After cloning the repository, please access the data files through this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1sGKPZPky4w3KAX_RrDG1Qw58VbvojLY7). Ensure you have the appropriate permissions to download the files.

2. **Create Subdirectories**:  
   In the `Data` directory, create the following three subdirectories:
    - `processed-data/`: For storing pre-processed data files.
    - `raw-data/`: For storing the original raw data files.
    - `results/`: For storing any output files generated from the model predictions or analysis.

3. **Copy Data Files**:  
   Download the data files from the Google Drive link and copy them into the appropriate subdirectories (`processed-data/`, `raw-data/`, or `results/`) based on their usage.

Once the data is organized, youâ€™ll be ready to proceed with running the models and analysis scripts in this repository.
