# Models
The repository is structured as follows:

- **`ardl`/**: Contains scripts and notebooks for the ARDL (Autoregressive Distributed Lag) model, focusing on relationships between variables over time.
- **`lstm`/**: Contains scripts and notebooks for the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model, designed to handle sequential data for time series forecasting.
- **`sarima`/**: Contains scripts and notebooks for the SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model, suitable for time series with seasonal components.
- **`tft`/**: Contains scripts and notebooks for the TFT (Temporal Fusion Transformer) model, which leverages attention mechanisms for time series analysis.
- **`transformer`/**: Contains scripts and notebooks for the Transformer model, a deep learning approach for sequential data.
