# Evaluation

Before running the evaluation notebook (`evaluation.ipynb`), please ensure that the `Data` folder is set up correctly (as outlined in the [README in the `/data` folder](../data/README.md)). This setup includes the following three subdirectories:

- `processed-data/` – for processed data files.
- `raw-data/` – for the raw data files.
- `results/` – for storing the output results from the model predictions and analysis.

You can access the necessary data files through this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1sGKPZPky4w3KAX_RrDG1Qw58VbvojLY7). Make sure to download the relevant files and place them in the appropriate subdirectories.

Once the data folder is organized and the `results/` folder contains the necessary results files, you can proceed to run `evaluation.ipynb`.

**Important**: Ensure that all required data files are in the correct subdirectories and that the `results/` folder is properly set up with the previous results for the code to run without errors.
