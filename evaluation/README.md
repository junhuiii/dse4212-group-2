# Evaluation

Before running the evaluation notebook (`evaluation.ipynb`), please ensure that the `Data` folder is set up correctly. This setup includes the three subdirectories (`processed-data/`, `raw-data/`, and `results/`) with the necessary data files placed in each.

Once the data folder is organized, you can proceed to run `evaluation.ipynb`

Make sure that all required data files are in the correct subdirectories before running the evaluation to avoid any errors.
