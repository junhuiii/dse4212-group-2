# Data Pull

The `data_pull.ipynb` notebook is designed to pull data from TradingView. While a copy of the actual data is already available in the Google Drive (as outlined in the [README in the `/data` folder](../data/README.md)), you can use this notebook to manually retrieve the latest data if needed.

## Steps to Pull Data Manually

1. **Open `data_pull.ipynb`**:  
   Launch the `data_pull.ipynb` notebook.

2. **Run the Notebook**:  
   Follow the instructions in the notebook to connect to TradingView and pull the data for the required tickers. The notebook will guide you through the process of fetching the data for the selected stocks and futures.

3. **Data Storage**:  
   The data pulled will be stored in the `raw-data` folder (or as specified in the notebook), which is where the data from TradingView will be saved.

Note: While the data can be pulled manually, it's recommended to use the pre-existing data in the drive for quicker setup. Refer to the [README in the `/data` folder](../data/README.md) for more details on data organization.
